Currently: Beginning to learn about the algorithm. Unsure of implementation.

    SVM - Support Vector Machine
        Used to classify Linear or Nonlinear data.
            Facial detection, anomaly detection, and text classification
        We basically are trying to find the maximum hyperplane between sets, in order to "separate" the chunks of data/


        Supporting terminology:

        Threshold: The hyperplane at which a point changes classifications
        Margin: the "space" between the closest point to the hyperplane and the threshold

        In order to make our margin less sensitive, we must allow for misclassifications



        Kernel function: a function used to take in data and stransform it to the form its needed in.
            Used to find the Support Vector Classifier

            Polynomial, Radial, and Exponential kernels functions are some examples.

        The Kernel Trick: Treating the data as if it already exists in a higher dimension, and just comparing the data to itself.
            This reduces computation power, by avoiding lots of transform math.
