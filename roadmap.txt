Howdy!

TerraVista is a personal project designed to allow me learn more about Machine Learning.
TerraVista (TV), while still in a fairly early stage, has allowed me to learn so much about leading a project.
Despite the only project member being me, I have already learned a lot about what it means to create a project from the ground up.

While I don't have specific dates or goals for this project, I do have a list of algorithms and that I would like to experiement with.
I'm still at a stage as to whether or not I would like to make these algorithms work, or just use these experiences to tinker with the algorithms.

With that said: here are some more algorithms that I have/would like to experiment with:
        Linear Regression
        Logistic Regression
        SVM

While I would like to tinker with neural networks, I'm unsure of how to efficiently implement the required Matrix mathematics in C++. More research will be required.
